# Last Funkin Moments

We have:
- Week Strong! vs. Hookx the friendly karaoke robot! ft. 3 TheFatRat Songs: Windfall, Rule The World, We'll meet again
- new **UNIQUE** stages (which unfortunately are also hard code too):
  - Jakarta Fair. inside one of the walking mini booth in the Van Elektronische booth
  - Qmoveph. our default background found in our softwares consisting of stars and circles, complemented with a blue hue on the top, gradiently browns towards the bottom, both sides loopable.
  - Fieldes. Yards with a bunch of hills behind it.
  - Cruel Thesis. a background with self explanatory accent strip on the bottom left corner with Van Elektronische brand logo in the center, complemented with purple themed hue diagonal gradients.
  - Colors screens!!! Solid color screen for chroma keying purposes! there are: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, White, Blank! The characters and gf also also far distanced for easy management and further keyings later.
- new **UNIQUE** characters! (pls fix so I don't have to hard code):
  - Hookx the friendly karaoke robot. it's a portrait TV that can walk! it can also swivel its head 90 degrees!
  - Home Theater, while Girlfriend was busy looking for fashion or whatever physical distancing occassion needed, this Home theater is here. it has a modular landscape TV (which the screen and the computer (called TV evolution box thingy) are separatable), Sondkart GF-100 Soundbar, and a furniture to hold the TV evolution box and the soundbar.
  - **Boyfriend COVID-19 edition!** Boyfriend follows health protocol by **wearing mask** because he is outside. (bruh, he should've also been complying that on his home state lmao, but eh, COVID-19 is "*dead*" (technically no. they're already endemic unfortunately), humanity has reached peak herd immunity anyway, yeah but still) (but brother, bf's first week was on like 2020, and then subsequent was around 2021, oh no! and North America (US & probably Canada) had their worst time period during the peak rise of COVID-19!!!). Yeah just wear mask anyway when going out idk what comes here.
- **All without replacing weeks, stages, or even skin at all!** the vanilla assets and stuff still remains intact! (the week 7 is missing ~~placeholder (High effort Ugh)~~ and the original week 7 exclusive embargo is still ongoing as of 23 May 2021, Kickstarter ended, please don't break promise about timed, okay!)
- `BETA` ways to load weeks!!! with `weekList.json` file (located in `Assets/data/weekList.json`), you can edit the variable right away without needing to recompile entire game. finally! add weeks without recompile! more procedural loadings to come. (Pls fix week loader so we don't have to hard code, I guess it's done, idk)
- **Fresh**ly Forked from Kade Engine with love yay!
- **VIDEO CUTSCENER!!!** You can insert video in your song!!! thancc @GrowtopiaFli for the system. Available for both the start and end of each song, each difficulty!!! wow!!!! you can e.g. have different video even on each difficulty!!! ***no way!!!*** this is what should've been.
- **CHANGES IN DEFAULT STAGE!!!** Now reinstalled stage light. but that's not all, **we also have added the light bloom on it as well!!!** hey, it even change color too on demand, such as every cheer!!! whoah!!!!
- **NEW LUA MODCHART FUNCTIONS!!!**. We mirrored our special functions for the lua modchart too aswell. We got Cheer Now, Cam Zoom in, Set Colorable Background color, randomize the color, and more. FINALLY!!! We're getting closer to obsolette the hard coding! yeah!
- idk what next?
- CODE LICENSED GNU GPL v3 instead of some sort of *Open Source but proprietarism-allowing-forking* licenses. ASSETS (only for Perkedel originals like Week Strong, Week 4'33") Licensed CC4.0-BY-SA as shown in GameBanana Page!!! yoinkers, **you can steal this (the original Perkedel week ones yess) but pls credit!** oh, better be higher quality than ever pls, not just mere reupload, yeah serious (okay irony prevention. if your mod has any quality changes except this mod you yoinked which means you just yoink my mod (because no idea what to mod in Last Funkin Moment right now), but you did made other enhancement (your original mod, quality change internal and external), that's completely fine.). and of course, Share Alike remember? yess!! OPEN SOURCE BOTH MODS & ASSETS, for real (The FLA, SVG, PSD, KRA, XM, BLEND, FBX, anything! all format). Yes, it's a great privillege that KadeEngine (and FNF formerly but still compliant) is licensed Apache (the one that is Android). This license allow forker to change license, don't know to where ups or down, but basically we can enforce more here yeah. Ah yess, finally. License that is not absolutely restrictive at all.

# Today's Update!
## Week Strong! vs. Hookx the friendly Karaoke robot!
After the coronavirus pandemic seems regressing day by day as many vaccines clouter finally reaches family level, Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Pico, and families got their vaccines and all people can finally travel freely to all countries. The humanity once again gained victory in herd immunity. But what shall they do?

Boyfriend decided to go on to the opposite side of the world *to prove that he is the best rapper all around the world* (actually no, they're just bored after finding somebody to compete against, so..). well, turns out, that opposite side of the world isn't much edge of the world, infact that's where JOELwindows7 comes from, Indonesia. He heard from news that *the largest expo in Southeast Asia is going to open* at Jakarta. So then he invited all his friends and families to fly to Jakarta, Indonesia.

Jakarta Fair finally opens again after the gruelling cruelty of coronavirus has finally defeated. Boyfriend and families went to Jakarta fair for mere curiosity and who knows find someone that would compete with him. It had alot of stuffs, so they separate a while to look for interesting stuffs around the fair. Girlfriend will search for fashions, while Boyfriend looks for technologies. He found one of the megabooth that has sophisticated walking minibooth in it, Van Elektronische (Perkedel Technologies). He entered one of the booth and encountered Hookx, the friendly Karaoke robot.

Well, it's not the live person he met but another robot instead. Why not try though? I think Hookx got something interesting. So then Boyfriend proceed interacting with that robot that shapped like a portrait TV.

BONUS WEEK! 4'33" . John Cage - 4'33" did made a composition. and it's silent. just that. that's it. yes.

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Better key layouts**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, now you can play with DFJK!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
