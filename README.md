# Last Funkin Moments
collection of FNF mods by Perkedel! Enjoy the funkin moment while it still last!

We have:
- Week Strong! vs. Hookx the friendly karaoke robot! ft. 3 TheFatRat Songs: Windfall, Rule The World, We'll meet again
- new **UNITQUE** stages (which unfortunately are also hard code too):
  - Jakarta Fair. inside one of the walking mini booth in the Van Elektronische booth
  - Qmoveph. our default background found in our softwares consisting of stars and circles, complemented with a blue hue on the top, gradiently browns towards the bottom, both sides loopable.
  - Fieldes. Yards with a bunch of hills behind it.
  - Cruel Thesis. a background with self explanatory accent strip on the bottom left corner with Van Elektronische brand logo in the center, complemented with purple themed hue diagonal gradients.
  - Colors screens!!! Solid color screen for chroma keying purposes! there are: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, White, Blank! The characters and gf also also far distanced for easy management and further keyings later.
- new **UNIQUE** characters!:
  - Hookx the friendly karaoke robot
  - Home Theater, while Girlfriend was busy looking for fashion or whatever physical distancing occassion needed, this Home theater is here. it has a modular landscape TV (which the screen and the computer (called TV evolution box thingy) are separatable), Sondkart GF-100 Soundbar, and a furniture to hold the TV evolution box and the soundbar.
- All without replacing weeks, stages, or even skin at all! the vanilla assets and stuff still remains intact! (the week 7 is missing placeholder (High effort Ugh) and the original week 7 exclusive embargo is still ongoing as of 23/05/2021, Kickstarter ended)
- ways to load weeks!!! with `weekList.json` file, you can edit the variable right away without needing to recompile entire game. finally! add weeks without recompile! more proceduralizer to come.
- Forked from Kade Engine with love yay!
- idk what next?

# Today's Update!
## Week Strong! vs. Hookx the friendly Karaoke robot!
After the coronavirus pandemic seems regressing day by day as many vaccines clouter finally reaches family level, Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Pico, and families got their vaccines and all people can finally travel freely to all countries. The humanity once again gained victory in herd immunity. But what shall they do?

Boyfriend decided to go on to the opposite side of the world *to prove that he is the best rapper all around the world* (actually no, they're just bored after finding somebody to compete against, so..). well, turns out, that opposite side of the world isn't much edge of the world, infact that's where JOELwindows7 comes from, Indonesia. He heard from news that *the largest expo in Southeast Asia is going to open* at Jakarta. So then he invited all his friends and families to fly to Jakarta, Indonesia.

Jakarta Fair finally opens again after the gruelling cruelty of coronavirus has finally defeated. Boyfriend and families went to Jakarta fair for mere curiosity and who knows find someone that would compete with him. It had alot of stuffs, so they separate a while to look for interesting stuffs around the fair. Girlfriend will search for fashions, while Boyfriend looks for technologies. He found one of the megabooth that has sophisticated walking minibooth in it, Van Elektronische (Perkedel Technologies). He entered one of the booth and encountered Hookx, the friendly Karaoke robot.

Well, it's not the live person he met but another robot instead. Why not try though? I think Hookx got something interesting. So then Boyfriend proceed interacting with that robot that shapped like a portrait TV.

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Better key layouts**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, now you can play with DFJK!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
