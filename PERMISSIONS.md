# Status of Permission Recipience. Is Perkedel accepting exclusive permission grant right now? 
## Active

~~Perkedel Technologies and affiliates is not accepting permission right now. To be featured in this mod, you must make sure your license is permissive, **without requiring to request permission from authors related**. Additionally, you also have to make sure that commercial use (such as deployment in monetized environments like coin operated arcade machines, except paywalled resales obviously) are allowed as well, although not mandatory, but may increase the chance.~~

You will get the following permission request that looks like this, from any Perkedel members such as JOELwindows7 (Joel Robert Justiawan)

```
# Hey can I use this one up here?
pls?
```

or anything that looks like asking for permission.

To accept the following request, simply reply that message with sentence that node towards *agreement* such as `Yes`, `Yes, you may`, `Go ahead`, etc. etc. Remember, **there will be no undo once we have captured your response**, therefore please consider carefully.

# In event of betrayal of licenses & permissions
If you found that authors of above yoinks and used things betrayed their license, immediately send message using this `ISSUE`, with title containing `(BETRAYALS) Author_name Assets_betrayed`.
