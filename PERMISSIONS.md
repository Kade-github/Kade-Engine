# Status of Permission Recipience. Is Perkedel accepting exclusive permission grant right now? 
**Inactive**

Perkedel Technologies and affiliates is not accepting permission right now. To be featured in this mod, you must make sure your license is permissive, **without requiring to request permission from authors related**. Additionally, you also have to make sure that commercial use (such as deployment in monetized environments like coin operated arcade machines, except paywalled resales obviously) are allowed as well, although not mandatory, but may increase the chance.

If you found that authors of above yoinks and used things betrayed their license, immediately send message using this `ISSUE`, with title containing `(BETRAYALS) Author_name Assets_betrayed`.
