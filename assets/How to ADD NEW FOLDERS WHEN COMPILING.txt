Alright so lets say you compiled the game but the folders you added are missing, well.

1. Open the project.xml file in the main root assets
2. Look for something like "<library name="week6"    preload="true" />"
3. For that, copy it and then just replace "week6" with the folder name you added.
4. Folders inside other folders have to be edited in this way also, so for example:

<library name="week69/folder"    preload="true" />

5. do this for other instances of folders in the .xml file.
